<h2 align="center">My Software Projects</h2>

<p align="left"> <strong>FURYROAM:</strong> https://travel-recommendation-ocw2.onrender.com/

-This was a group project asking the user a series of questions based on travel preference. It communicates with several public APIs and presents recommendations through a dynamic interactive globe API, alongside information of the recommended place. (Note the deployed link uses on-render’s free service so application typically needs a bit of time, no more than 5 minutes to work effectively)

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, APIs 

<strong>ACEBOOK</strong>

-This was a group project that functions as a Facebook clone. It allows the user to sign up, log in and continue to be logged in through use of sessions and tokens. Users can view all posts, create new ones, like posts (which are tracked), comment on posts and like comments.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node, Flask, HTML, CSS

<strong>MAKERSBNB</strong>

-This was a group project that simulates the Airbnb website. It deals with databases and allows users to post and book properties for set time periods.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS</p>
